This folder includes the usage of deep neural network to solve a basic problem of predicting if patient is diabetic or not.
Instead of picking the features manually, like we do in traditional machine learning algorithms, deep neural network model with batch normalization and 3 dense layers with varying nodes are used in this code.
Hidden layers uses ReLU as the activation function and output layer has the sigmoid as the activation function.
Model is trained using stochastic gradient descent as optimizer, binary cross entropy as the loss function and accuracy as the metric.
Achieved an accuracy of 75.08% on training data and 72.08% on validation data.
We can always tweak the hyper parameters to achieve better performance. :)
